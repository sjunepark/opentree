I must remember not to edit repo files at this stage. I’ll output in JSON format with the required schema: a decision on execution or decomposition, a summary, and any children arrays.\n\nI've selected the node for the Justfile and CI Workflow. It’s crucial to check if the just ci command will run successfully, which involves examining the Justfile, running formatting checks, and executing tests. Given the complexity of this task, I might lean towards decomposition."}}

I’m leaning towards execution since it feels straightforward: I can inspect the Justfile and CI configuration and implement the just ci recipe.\n\nYet, I wonder about potential unknowns, like whether the current just ci exists or if it might fail due to not being installed. \n\nFor this execution stage, editing the repo comes later. The tree summary indicates a failure at another node, but since I see no failure here, I’ll decide to execute. I’ll return the decision with a summary, including an empty children array as required by the schema."}}
