My first step involves exploring the repository, which I'll do using commands like `ls` and `find`, and I'll also read the Justfile. I might use `rg` for searching too. It feels like a solid approach to understanding the structure and contents of the repo. So, let’s kick things off with listing the files!"}}

It seems that `just` looks for `justfile` or `Justfile`, and I'm wondering if it’s case-insensitive. Based on what I've seen, it's called `justfile` in the repository, so I believe it should work. I think I should inspect this further to confirm how the casing is handled."}}

That seems correct. I want to confirm that `just ci` is in place and handles formatting checks along with `go test ./...`, which it does. However, failures could happen if gofmt isn’t installed. It should typically come with Go, but that might not be true in all environments. We could try using `go fmt` if needed. The key is to run `just ci` to ensure everything succeeds. Let’s proceed with that."}}
