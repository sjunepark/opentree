# System Improvement Ideas

Append-only (or mostly append-only) backlog of ideas to improve the runner + agent loop.

This is **not** the task tree. It’s memory: suggestions that can later become nodes if/when prioritized.

## Template

### YYYY-MM-DD — Idea title

- **Problem:** what hurts today
- **Idea:** proposed change
- **Why it helps:** expected impact
- **Cost / risk:** what could go wrong
- **Next:** how to validate / implement

## Common categories

- Tooling (Playwright, Chrome DevTools, PDF readers, MCP servers, etc)
- Prompting (DECOMPOSE/EXECUTE templates, stricter output formats, examples)
- Determinism (tie-break rules, state-machine tests, event/log formats)
- Safety (workspace confinement, allow/deny lists, timeouts/output limits)
- UX (CLI output, eventual tree visualization)
