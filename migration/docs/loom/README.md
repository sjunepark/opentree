# Loom Study Notes

This directory contains notes and takeaways from reviewing the sibling project `../loom`.

Loom is a Rust-based AI coding agent with a large spec pack, a strict tool system, and an explicit
agent state machine. We are using it as a reference implementation to inform this repo’s pivot
toward a deterministic, goal-driven looping system.
