# Task i

## Focus

Identify the exact changes needed in `PROPOSAL2.md` (content gaps, wording, and structure) and list any
open questions that block writing.

## Inputs

- `PROPOSAL2.md`
- `VISION.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `runner/src/io/executor.rs` (current `codex exec` integration surface)

## Work

1. Re-read `PROPOSAL2.md` end-to-end and annotate: missing tradeoffs, unclear assumptions, and any stale
   claims.
2. Cross-check that referenced file paths / behaviors match the current codebase.
3. Write a short checklist of edits to make (headings/sections to add, bullets to reword, items to
   move/delete).

## Output

## Handoff
